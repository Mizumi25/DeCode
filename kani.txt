Yes fix it,see the image,i drag a container see the image,there is blue box,but did you know which one element i drag?its the second container with the ,the one with drag here second one in the canva in the image,see the ghost is vertically above where i am tpiching cjrrently which is the drag here is where i am hding lol hahahab, anywaus you also forgot where when I hold on a element it should literally dissapear in canva since its now in my hand as a ghost and then other elements will take the space of that elemwnt i took or pick up rayher, and also fix the insicators overlays didnt show even when i turn it on in property panel, while you are at it, add a toggle in the overlay dropdown, when on, when i drag a component in canva and the other components will adjust right?? Which I currently already have literally hahahah, but when turn off, the one i drag doesnt affect others except the time when other components takes the missing space from the one i drag, so yeah when turned off it wont affect and move other component when hovered above tjem, much like ghost, do you get me? 


soon :handle special characterssssss
